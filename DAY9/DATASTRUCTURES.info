Detail inforamtion:
Bubble sort - Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by 
              repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
Selection sort - It sorts an array by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) 
                 element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
                 This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
                 1.First we find the smallest element and swap it with the first element. 
                 This way we get the smallest element at its correct position.
                 2.Then we find the smallest among remaining elements (or second smallest) and 
                 swap it with the second element.
                 3.We keep doing this until we get all elements moved to correct position
Insertion Sort - Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting 
                 each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion
                  of the list
                  1.We start with the second element of the array as
                   the first element is assumed to be sorted.
                  2.Compare the second element with the first element if the
                   second element is smaller then swap them.
                  3.Move to the third element, compare it with the first two elements, 
                  and put it in its correct position
                  4.Repeat until the entire array is sorted
Linear Search - It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found 
                or the whole list has been searched.
Binary Search - Binary Search Algorithm is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by 
                repeatedly dividing the search interval in half
